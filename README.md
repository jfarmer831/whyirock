Why I Rock non-profit organization draft.

This website is currently in the building phase. I am volunteering to create the first website for a local non profit Oranization "Why I Rock". 
These files only serve as a draft until the url is launched and hosted. Feel free to launch this html site to see what I have accomplished for
this organization up to date. The future functionality I plan to add will be:
  Imbeded Youtube videos of prior conferences, online registration ability and a contact us form page.
